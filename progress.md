- Checked HPG connection: `ssh -O check hpg` → master running (pid=55446), OK.
- Ran `squeue -u $USER` on HPG: no jobs queued or running (empty queue).
- Nothing pending; no run submitted this check.

### Task: push Run F's collapse onset from Vd~0.3V to Vd~3V

Goal: keep Run F's dramatic collapse shape (7.8/7.0 mA/mm pre-collapse, ~1000x
drop, creep-up after) but move the onset ~10x later in Vd.

Per the "onset Vd scales roughly as 1/sqrt(hotTau)" trend (section 10),
reaching onset~3V from F's onset~0.3V by hotTau alone needs hotTau scaled by
(0.3/3)^2 = 1/100, i.e. hotTau ~= 1.3e-13/100 = 1.3e-15 s. That is a 100x
extrapolation past anything tested (smallest tested/planned so far is
4e-14, then 0.4-0.6e-13 next). 1.3e-15 s (1.3 fs) is faster than typical
energy relaxation times (~0.1-1 ps) - i.e. this pushes hotTau to a value
that isn't really physical on its own.

Ran two local coarse probes (uncommitted, deleted after use), Vd 0-4V in
0.25V steps, F's trap params (trapPeak=4e18, trapSigma=0.04, trapLevel=0.55,
hotEb=0.5), varying only hotTau:

- **hotTau=1.3e-15** (the naive 1/sqrt(hotTau) extrapolation): no collapse
  at all through Vd=4V. Id rises smoothly to 115 mA/mm (normal saturating
  Id-Vd), peak Te only reaches 353K vs 300K lattice - nowhere near enough
  to cross the 0.5 eV hot-capture barrier. The scaling law was fit from a
  2-point range near hotTau~1e-13 and does not hold 100x out; at this
  hotTau the hot-electron heating term is just too weak, full stop, not
  merely "later."
- **hotTau=1e-14** (10x below F, not 100x): partial effect. Id peaks at
  42.4 mA/mm (Vd=0.75V), sags to 28.9 (Vd=1.25V, ~1.5x drop, not ~1000x),
  then recovers/creeps up to 45.7 by Vd=4V. Peak Te reaches 1044K by Vd=4,
  much hotter than the 1.3e-15 case but still nowhere near F's Te at its
  own collapse point (peak Te ~3000-8500K in `pulsedIV_F.csv`). So lower
  hotTau alone trades onset delay for collapse depth - it does not give a
  later *and* dramatic collapse with F's trap charge.

**Conclusion:** hotTau alone can't hit onset~3V while keeping the dramatic
(~1000x) depth. Getting there needs more total trapped charge
(trapPeak x trapSigma^2) to compensate the weaker/later heating, i.e. a
joint (trapPeak, hotTau) search, not a 1-D hotTau extrapolation. This
is a physics/lever decision beyond what the documented single-variable
trend covers, so flagging before committing HPG resources to a grid.

**Proposed HPG grid** (`ee1` QOS currently idle - `squeue -A ee1` shows
0 jobs, full 19-CPU headroom):
- trapPeak in {4e18 (F), 6e18, 8e18}, trapSigma=0.04 fixed (watch for
  channel pinch-off at rest/Vd=0 - the noted risk point for high trapPeak
  was with trapSigma=0.025; 0.04 spreads it more, but should still check
  each task's Vd=0.1-0.2 baseline before trusting the rest)
- hotTau in {1e-14, 0.7e-14, 0.5e-14}
- hotEb=0.5, trapLevel=0.55, trapMeanY=0.20 fixed (F's values)
- 9-task array, coarse Vd_step=0.15 out to Vd_max=4.05 (28 points/task,
  ~74 min extrapolated from the 45min/17-point baseline; asking for
  --time=01:30:00, --mem=4gb, --cpus-per-task=1, --array=0-8%9)
- Once a combo lands onset near 3V with a ~1000x drop, follow up with a
  single full-resolution (0.1V step) confirmation run.

**Ian approved the grid as proposed.** Made `pulsedIV.tcl`'s levers
`info-exists`-guarded (defaults unchanged) so tasks can override them,
committed `pulsedIV_lateOnset.slurm` + `params_lateOnset.txt`, pushed
(ea69ef7), pulled on HPG, `mkdir -p results/20260924_lateOnset`, and
submitted: **job 43252782, array 0-8 (9 tasks)**, `ee1` QOS was idle
before submit. Writing per-task CSVs `pulsedIV_tp<trapPeak>_ht<hotTau>.csv`
+ `params.json` into `results/20260924_lateOnset/task_<id>/`. Polling
`squeue -u $USER` every ~3 min; will check every task's `.out`/`.err` for
Newton failures/NaN/OOM once it finishes, then `rsync` back and plot.
